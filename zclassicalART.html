                <p class="pp35">
                    Classical Art encompasses the cultures of Greece and Rome and endures as the cornerstone of Western 
                    civilization. Including innovations in painting, sculpture, decorative arts, and architecture, Classical 
                    Art pursued ideals of beauty, harmony, and proportion, even as those ideals shifted and changed over the 
                    centuries. While often employed in propagandistic ways, the human figure and the human experience of space 
                    and their relationship with the gods were central to Classical Art.

                                The House of Livia is an almost 2,000-year-old Roman residence that boasts some of the most stunning 
                                wall frescoes and floor mosaics you could have witnessed back in the time of imperial Rome. And 
                                fortunately for modern-day art enthusiasts, the House of Livia still retains almost all of its 
                                spellbinding beauty. The house is said to be the residence of Augustus’ wife, Livia, a woman who was
                                so powerful and influential in her time that even the Roman Senate recognized her with the title 
                                Mater Patriae or Mother of the Fatherland. The inner walls of the House of Livia have some 
                                captivating and realistic wall paintings depicting the beauty of nature. Exotic birds, plants, 
                                flowers, trees; the flora and fauna have been painted with such great attention to detail that 
                                researchers were even able to identify individual species. Even though it is almost 2,000 years 
                                old, it is still a magnificent example of natural beauty portrayed through art.

                                There is a tragic pathos to this mighty sculpture of a dying hero from a temple on the Greek island of 
                                Aegina. Tragedy is a Greek concept. The tragedies of Sophocles, Euripides and Aeschylus are still 
                                performed. This statue shows a strong man fallen, heroic to his last breath.

                                This monumental column stands as a landmark in the city and is one of the best-preserved monuments of 
                                ancient Rome. A stunning structure just by itself, there are in addition a total of 2,662 figures carved 
                                into its surface depicting 155 different scenes, allowing it to tell a story of its own. The various 
                                scenes portray famous marches by the Roman legions, huge battles (especially ones from the Dacian Wars), 
                                negotiations, sacrifices, Trajan’s speeches, and many more contemporary political events. In the scenes 
                                from the battles in Dacia, Trajan himself is a prominent figure in the scriptural narrative performing 
                                various military tasks. Needless to say, Trajan’s Column and its spiral narrative give a detailed insight 
                                into the coordination, administration, and operations of the Roman army. Given its historical significance 
                                and prominence as a long-standing landmark, the Column of Trajan has been attracting artists and historians 
                                for a very long time.

                                Classical Greek art changed rapidly as Greece itself went through wars and imperial transformations. In 
                                what is called the Hellenistic age it became much more emotional, sensual and even sensationalist. The 
                                furious sculptures on the Pergamon altar – which can be seen in its own museum in The Lora site, Berlin – 
                                are full of passion and psychological drama.

                                These tremendous statues found in the sea off southern Italy in 1972 are important because so few original 
                                Greek bronze statues survive. Most of the classical nudes in museums were carved in marble in the Roman era, 
                                as reproductions of such rare, and now largely lost, originals. Here we see the true majesty of Greek art 
                                in its classical age, which occurred in the fifth-century BC.

                                The building of the Altar of Augustan Peace was commissioned by the Roman Senate on July 4, 13 BC to honor 
                                Emperor Augustus, who was returning from successful campaigns in Spain and Gaul. On its completion on January 
                                30, 9 BC, it was arguably one of the finest examples of Roman art, and a huge leap in the Roman art of 
                                portraiture. Surrounded by high walls, Ara Pacis has two entrances, one on the east and another on the west. 
                                Almost all the inner and outer walls have been carved with beautiful sculptures and decorative friezes. But it 
                                is the decoration on the exterior of the precinct walls that stands out, along with depictions of a procession 
                                of imperial house members on the north and south walls. The east and west walls are carved with images that highlight 
                                the themes of peace and Roman civic rituals. The Romans enjoyed a period of remarkable peace during the reign of 
                                Augustus, and the altar itself became symbolic of Pax (meaning peace), something that Augustus was able to maintain for 
                                a significant proportion of his reign.

                                The Villa of Mysteries could have fallen into ruin when Mount Vesuvius erupted in 79 AD, but fortunately it 
                                only suffered minor damage and most of its walls along with their sculptures and frescoes survived. What 
                                made this villa stand out was a room within it which was decorated with mesmerizing scenes. This room, 
                                located at the front right of the villa, is now known as the Initiation Chamber. The word “mysteries” 
                                refers to the mysterious initiation rituals which some individuals undertook when they reached adulthood. 
                                Another interpretation states that the frescoes depict a young girl taking part in a ceremonial marriage, 
                                following the rituals required to achieve womanhood. Rather than documenting a person’s life achievements, 
                                the frescoes in this room show a person’s moral development through the various stages of life.

                                This majestic bronze, found in the sea off Greece, conveys the magic of Greek mythology. The god – 
                                probably Zeus, lord of Olympus himself – is caught in the act of hurling a thunderbolt. His body is charged 
                                with divine power, and yet, it is a human body, neither colossal nor ethereal but the mirror of ourselves. 
                                The Greek gods are human, all too human, and their petty squabbles cause wars and sorrow in the world.

                                Violence is a favourite theme of ancient Greek artists. Reared on the myth of the Trojan war and 
                                experiencing the reality of wars with Persia and between Greek cities, classical artists found new 
                                ways to show conflict. This human fighting a centaur, carved for the Parthenon in Athens, is 
                                astonishingly real in its detail and dynamic energy.

                                Roman emperors had a thing for establishing larger-than-life triumphal monuments that glorified 
                                the major achievements and victories of their reigns. So when the last great Roman emperor Constantine 
                                marched back into Rome after a successful campaign against Maxentius at the Battle of Milvian Bridge, 
                                he decided to have a monumental arch built to remind the Roman people of his decisive victory over such 
                                a formidable enemy. The Arch of Constantine is the largest surviving triumphal arch and since the Roman 
                                Empire collapsed at the end of Constantine’s reign, it is also the last great monument of imperial Rome. 
                                At an imposing height of 21 meters and with an even larger width, this giant monument consisted of three 
                                separate arches – a large one at the center and two shorter ones on either side. The lower part of the 
                                arch contains art depicting the Battle of Milvian Bridge.
