                    Modern art includes artistic work produced during the period extending roughly from the 1860s to the 1970s, 
                    and denotes the styles and philosophies of the art produced during that era. The term is usually associated 
                    with art in which the traditions of the past have been thrown aside in a spirit of experimentation.

                                In the early 1900s, Marcel Duchamp rejected what was known as retinal art and instead hoped to produce 
                                art that challenged the mind. A proponent of Cubism, Conceptual Art and Dada, Nude Descending a Staircase 
                                No. 2 depicts a nude woman descending a flight of stairs. Using superimposed elements that evoke motion 
                                pictures and chronophotographic imagery, Nude was shown for the first time in Barcelona, Spain in 1917. 
                                Exhibited with works of Cubism, Fauvism and Futurism, Nude scandalized show-going folks, though it 
                                eventually became an iconic work of modern art.

                                A painter of American realism, Edward Hopper became known for his oil painting, though he also painted 
                                with water colors and became a printmaker in metal etching. Painting in both rural and urban settings, 
                                it was many years before Hopper developed his own popular style; in 1931 he sold 30 paintings. Certainly 
                                Hopper’s most well-known and influential painting is Nighthawks. By the way, the scene used for Nighthawks 
                                was a diner in Greenwich Village, demolished years ago. Shown for a month at the gallery, the painting 
                                finally sold for $3,000, good money in those days.

                                Interestingly, most of these paintings included gold leaf. Over-the-top sexually, for the time, some of 
                                these masterpieces were considered pornographic. Danaë features the young woman of Greek mythology who, 
                                while locked in a tower by her father, was visited by Zeus and later gave birth to Perseus. Also painted 
                                by such as artists as Titian and Rembrandt, Danaë was a symbol of divine love and transcendence.

                                A quintessential tortured genius, Vincent van Gogh, was a Dutch post-Impressionist painter who suffered 
                                from mental illness his entire life and died young at the age of 37. Though young when he died, he had 
                                produced a phenomenal amount of artworks – 2,100 of them, 860 of which were oil paintings. Also an 
                                impoverished man, van Gogh suffered from psychosis, delusions and what could be considered clinical 
                                depression. When he could no longer live with his mental issues, he shot himself in the chest with a 
                                revolver and perished two days later. The Starry Night is certainly one of his best paintings, though it 
                                would be impossible to pick the best, wouldn’t it?

                                Around 1900 Matisse became a leader of the Fauves (French for wild beasts), that is, painters who 
                                emphasized painterly values and the bold use of color, sometimes in a dissonant way, and relied less on 
                                representation or realism. Fauvism only lasted a few years, yet Matisse had found his artistic niche, 
                                though his seemingly undisciplined painting drew much criticism. Nevertheless, from 1906 to 1917 Matisse 
                                may have created his best paintings, and Joy of Life is certainly an example of his apex output.

                                in Paris during World War II. Picasso was often harassed by the Gestapo, which liked to search his 
                                apartment. One time an officer found a photo of Guernica and asked Picasso, “Did you paint that?” And

                                Édouard Manet’s paintings are considered integral aspects of the beginning of modern art in the Western 
                                tradition. Manet, whose work bridged the gap between realism and Impressionism in the 1860s, began his 
                                artistic career by copying the work of Old Masters in the Louvre in Paris. Luncheon on the Grass, a 
                                pastoral scene using the juxtaposition of two fully dressed men and one nude woman (the woman appearing 
                                relaxed and painted in a sketchy fashion) was controversial at the time, which perhaps explains why the 
                                painting was rejected by the Paris Salon when it was first entered.

                                Perhaps the greatest painter of Abstract Expressionism, Jackson Pollock created his best paintings by 
                                using what’s called action painting, a technique began in the early twentieth century by artists such 
                                as Frances Picabia and Max Ernst, though Pollock applied paint horizontally by dripping, pouring, 
                                splashing or spraying upon what was usually a very large canvas. Perhaps Pollock’s greatest period 
                                producing drip paintings was from 1947 to 1950. Many of these paintings eventually sold for tens of 
                                millions of dollars.

                                medical problems the rest of her life, Frida Kahlo had an impressive career as a Mexican Surrealist 
                                painter (or Magical Realist, painters using realism with fantasy elements added). While living, Kahlo 
                                wasn’t well known as an artist, simply muralist Diego Rivera’s wife, until the 1970s, that is, when her 
                                legacy attacked the attention of Chicanos, feminists, the LGBTQ movement and Native Americans. Now people 
                                wrote books about her! Kahlo’s painting, The Love Embrace of the Universe, shows Kahlo with Diego Rivera, 
                                as they’re embraced by Mexico, the Earth and the Universe. Often mythologized, for better or worse, Kahlo 
                                has become one of the most recognized artists of the twentieth century. Interestingly, in 2018, the San

                                Battle of Lights, Coney Island was one of the first successful paintings of American Futurism. Thereafter, 
                                Stella became a renowned painter in the New York art scene, though his work attracted much criticism from 
                                conservative art critics who found works of modernism threatening and impossible to define. Be that as it 
                                may, during the late 1930s and into the ‘40s, Stella’s painting style became more realistic and baroque, 
                                which didn’t fit the modernist - much less avant-garde - mold, so the art world forgot about him.
