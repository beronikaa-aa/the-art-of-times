                <p class="pp35">
                    Romanticism was a movement that dominated all genres; including literature, music, art and architecture; 
                    in Europe and the United States in the first half of the 19th century. It originated in late 18th century 
                    as a reaction against the ideals of order, calm, harmony, idealization and rationality which marked 
                    Classicism in general and late 18th-century Neoclassicism in particular. Romanticism laid emphasis on 
                    emotion and individualism as well as glorification of the past and of nature. The artists of the movement 
                    created works which highlighted that sense and emotions were as important in experiencing the world as 
                    reason and balance. Romanticism saw major development in landscape painting with the genre, then 
                    considered low art, being elevated to a level rivalling history painting.

                                Liberty has existed as a goddess in many cultures and during the French Revolution, many allegorical 
                                personifications of ‘Liberty’ appeared in France. Since then the figure of Liberty is viewed as a symbol 
                                of France and the French Republic. This painting commemorates the July Revolution of 1830 in which King 
                                Charles X of France was overthrown. It shows Liberty as both a goddess and a robust woman of the people. 
                                She holds the flag of France in one hand and a firearm in her other hand. Liberty Leading the People is a 
                                hugely influential artistic work. Among other things, it has been a source of inspiration for the Statue 
                                of Liberty and Victor Hugo’s renowned novel Les Misérables. Since its creation, the painting has also 
                                served as a republican and anti-monarchist symbol. The masterpiece of the leading French Romantic painter, 
                                Liberty Leading the People tops the list of the most famous paintings of the Romanticism movement.

                                Méduse was a French warship which fought in the Napoleonic Wars. Though it survived the battles, it crashed in 
                                a sandbank in July 1816 while transporting people to Senegal. The 400 people on board had to evacuate; out 
                                of which 151 were put on a raft. These men on the raft had to go through a terrible ordeal. Many were 
                                washed into the sea by a storm; others rebelled and were killed by officers; the survivors engaged in 
                                cannibalism; and when supplies ran low, injured men were thrown into the sea. After 13 days on sea, the 
                                raft was found with only 15 men surviving. The event became an international scandal. Théodore Géricault 
                                thoroughly studied the incident before creating this masterpiece. The Raft of the Medusa proved to be 
                                hugely influential in French art; is considered an iconic work of French Romanticism; and has immortalized 
                                the incident it depicts.

                                Caspar David Friedrich is considered the most important German Romantic artist. He is best known for works 
                                which put humans amid night skies, morning mists, barren trees, etc. thus illustrating diminished strength 
                                of man in the larger scale of life. In this painting, a man, formally dressed and holding a walking cane, 
                                stands on an outcropping of rocks with his back to the viewer. Thus the viewer is enabled to see the 
                                landscape covered in a thick sea of fog; at which the man looks contemplatively. Friedrich’s use of space 
                                illustrates man’s minuscule place in nature. The painting depicts various landmarks from the beautiful 
                                Elbe Sandstone Mountains in Saxony in southeastern Germany. Wanderer above the Sea of Fog is the most 
                                famous work of Caspar David Friedrich. It has become synonymous with the Romantic era and it is the best 
                                known landscape painting of the movement.

                                On May 2, 1808, the people of Madrid rebelled against the occupation of the city by Napoleon’s French army. Goya 
                                has captured this uprising in his painting The Second of May 1808. The Third of May 1808, the most famous 
                                painting by the artist, depicts the retaliation by the French the following day, during which hundreds of 
                                Spaniards were rounded up and shot. The painting has no distinct precedent as it diverges from the 
                                traditional depictions of war. Thus it is considered one of the first paintings of the modern era. Famous 
                                British art historian Kenneth Clark called Goya’s masterpiece as “the first great picture which can be 
                                called revolutionary in every sense of the word, in style, in subject, and in intention.” The Third of 
                                May has inspired several renowned paintings by future artists most prominently Pablo Picasso’s masterpiece 
                                Guernica.

                                Francesco Hayez was the leading artist of Romanticism in mid-19th-century Milan. His best known work, this 
                                painting depicts a couple from the Middle Ages, embracing while they kiss each other. It represents the 
                                main features of Italian Romanticism and has become an iconic work of the movement. The painting lays 
                                emphasis on emotion as opposed to rational thought in accordance with the principles of Romanticism. It 
                                has come to represent the spirit of Risorgimento, or Italian unification, which lasted from 1815 to 1871. 
                                It is also noted for its details and brilliant colours. The Kiss has enjoyed extreme popularity, 
                                especially in Italy, since its exhibition in 1859. It has also been a subject of great commentary and 
                                analysis. It is one of the most passionate and intense representations of a kiss in the history of Western 
                                art.

                                Among the best known works of Francisco Goya are his Black Paintings which portray intense, haunting themes; 
                                reflective of both his fear of insanity and his bleak outlook on humanity. These works were painted by 
                                Goya as murals on the walls of his house and were transferred to canvas years after his death. This 
                                disturbing portrait of Saturn consuming one of his children is the most famous of the 14 Black Paintings 
                                by Francisco Goya. It was one of the six paintings decorating his dining room. The masterpiece is based 
                                on the Roman myth by which the titan Saturn ate his children as it was prophesied that one of his sons 
                                would overthrow him, just like he had overthrown his father Caelus. The Prophesy does come to be true as 
                                his wife Ops deceives him and saves one of their sons.

                                Romantic English artists favoured landscape and the most influential among these was John Constable. The 
                                Hay Wain depicts a rural scene on the River Stour between the English counties of Suffolk and Essex. It 
                                is the area around where Constable was born; which is portrayed in his most celebrated masterpieces; and 
                                which came to be known as Constable Country. At the centre of the painting is a wooden wain, or large 
                                cart, which is being pulled across the river by three horses. The scene takes place near Flatford Mill, 
                                which was owned by Constable’s father. The left bank is in Suffolk while the landscape on the right bank 
                                is in Essex. The Hay Wain is revered as one of the greatest landscape Romantic paintings as well as among 
                                the best ever created by an English artist. In a 2005 poll organised by BBC, it was voted the second most 
                                popular painting in any British gallery after The Fighting Temeraire.

                                HMS Temeraire was a 98-gun second-rate warship of the Royal Navy which is famous for its heroic performance 
                                in the 1805 Battle of Trafalgar between U.K. and the combined fleets of French and Spanish Navies. J.M.W. 
                                Turner depicts the warship, years after its glorious days, being pulled by a tugboat, to be broken into 
                                scraps. The painting pays a tribute to sailing ships as they were going to be replaced by steam-powered 
                                vessels. Turner uses symbolism, like the setting sun, to suggest the demise of the subject and its 
                                mortality despite its heroic past. Painted by Turner at the prime of his career, The Fighting Temeraire 
                                is his most famous painting and the one he referred to as his “darling”. In 2005, it was voted as Britain’s 
                                favourite painting in a poll organized by the BBC.

                                Henry Fuseli was a prominent Swiss painter known for the supernatural elements in his works. This painting 
                                shows a ravished woman lying in deep sleep across a divan with her hands thrown back. Crouched on her 
                                chest is an ape like incubus, a mythological demon which lies upon sleeping women in order to engage in 
                                sexual activity with them. The scene also features a mysterious black mare who peeps through the red 
                                curtains. Interpretations of the painting vary. The most simple one is that it portrays a dreaming woman 
                                and the content of her nightmare. Usually critics agree that the painting has sexual themes and probably 
                                intends to show a female orgasm. The Nightmare created a sensation when it was first exhibited and it soon 
                                became hugely popular. It was met with horrified fascination, was widely analysed and inspired not only 
                                artistic but also literary works. It is definitely one of the momentous works of the Romanticism movement.

                                Francisco Goya is regarded as the most important Spanish artist of late 18th and early 19th centuries; 
                                and one of the great portraitists of modern times. The Nude Maja, one of his masterpieces, is known as the 
                                first “totally profane life-size female nude in Western art” and the first large Western painting to 
                                depict female pubic hair without obvious negative connotations. The painting was most likely commissioned 
                                by Prime Minister of Spain, Manuel de Godoy. The identity of the model is not known with certainty. Likely 
                                candidates are Godoy’s mistress Pepita Tudo and María Cayetana de Silva, 13th Duchess of Alba. Known for 
                                the straightforward and unashamed view of the model towards the viewer, it is considered a revolutionary 
                                work which expanded the horizons of Western art.
