                <p class="pp35">
                    Although the history of Medieval art covers almost ten centuries between the Sack of Rome (c.450 CE) and 
                    the Early Italian Renaissance (1400), Western Medieval art is limited to Byzantine culture (Eastern Roman 
                    Empire), Hiberno-Saxon Insular art, artworks from the royal courts of Charlemagne and his Ottonian 
                    successors, and finally - from roughly 1000 onwards - the European-wide movements of Christian art, known 
                    as Romanesque and Gothic. It was only during the final 400 years that the individual names of painters, 
                    sculptors and other decorative artists began to be recorded with any regularity. Thus most of our artists 
                    date from this period.

                                Insular art, also known as Hiberno-Saxon art, was produced in the post-Roman history of Ireland and Britain. 
                                The term derives from insula, the Latin term for "island"; in this period Britain and Ireland shared a 
                                largely common style different from that of the rest of Europe. Art historians usually group insular art 
                                as part of the Migration Period art movement as well as Early Medieval Western art, and it is the 
                                combination of these two traditions that gives the style its special character.

                                The Godescalc Evangelistary, Godescalc Sacramentary, Godescalc Gospels, or Godescalc Gospel Lectionary 
                                (Paris, BNF. lat.1203) is an illuminated manuscript in Latin made by the Frankish scribe Godescalc and 
                                today kept in the Bibliothèque nationale de France. It was commissioned by the Carolingian king Charlemagne 
                                and his wife Hildegard on October 7, 781 and completed on April 30, 783. The Evangelistary is the earliest 
                                known manuscript produced at the scriptorium in Charlemagne's Court School in Aachen. The manuscript was 
                                intended to commemorate Charlemagne's march to Italy, his meeting with Pope Adrian I, and the baptism of 
                                his son Pepin. The crediting of the work to Godescalc and the details of Charlemagne's march are contained 
                                in the manuscript's dedication poem.

                                Notre-Dame de Paris (French: [nɔtʁə dam də paʁi]; meaning "Our Lady of Paris"), referred to simply as 
                                Notre-Dame, is a medieval Catholic cathedral on the Île de la Cité in the 4th arrondissement of Paris. 
                                The cathedral was consecrated to the Virgin Mary and considered to be one of the finest examples of French 
                                Gothic architecture. Its pioneering use of the rib vault and flying buttress, its enormous and colourful 
                                rose windows, as well as the naturalism and abundance of its sculptural decoration set it apart from the 
                                earlier Romanesque style. Major components that make Notre Dame stand out include its large historic organ 
                                and its immense church bells.

                                designed by the Greek geometers Isidore of Miletus and Anthemius of Tralles. Built in 537 as the 
                                patriarchal cathedral of the imperial capital of Constantinople, it was the largest Christian church of 
                                the eastern Roman Empire (the Byzantine Empire) and the Eastern Orthodox Church, except during the Latin 
                                Empire from 1204 to 1261, when it became the city's Roman Catholic cathedral. In 1453, after the Fall of 
                                Constantinople to the Ottoman Empire, it was converted into a mosque. In 1935 the secular Turkish Republic 
                                established it as a museum. In 2020, it re-opened as a mosque.

                                converted into a mosque; it became a museum in 1945, but was turned back into a mosque in 2020. The

                                Measuring twenty inches high and almost 230 feet in length, the Bayeux Tapestry commemorates a struggle 
                                for the throne of England between William, the Duke of Normandy, and Harold, the Earl of Wessex (Normandy 
                                is a region in northern France). The year was 1066—William invaded and successfully conquered England, 
                                becoming the first Norman King of England (he was also known as William the Conqueror). The Bayeux 
                                Tapestry consists of seventy-five scenes with Latin inscriptions (tituli) depicting the events leading 
                                up to the Norman conquest and culminating in the Battle of Hastings in 1066. The textile's end is now 
                                missing, but it most probably showed the coronation of William as King of England.
