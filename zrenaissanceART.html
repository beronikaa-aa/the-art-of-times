                    The Renaissance was a period in European history marking the transition from the Middle Ages to modernity 
                    and covering the 15th and 16th centuries. It occurred after the Crisis of the Late Middle Ages and was 
                    associated with great social change.

                                The Birth of Venus has become one of the most famous works of the Renaissance and a lasting symbol of 
                                feminine grace and beauty. Venus is in fact an Italian Renaissance ideal: blonde, pale-skinned, 
                                voluptuous. Botticelli has picked out highlights in her hair with gold leaf and has emphasized the 
                                femininity of her body. In the Birth of Venus, Venus’ body is however, anatomically improbable, with 
                                elongated neck and torso. Her pose is impossible: although she stands in a classical stance, her weight 
                                is shifted too far over the left leg for the pose to be held.

                                The Last Judgement by Michelangelo covers the wall behind the altar in the Sistine Chapel. When 
                                executing his “Last Judgement” it would seem that Michelangelo had been given artistic licence to paint 
                                scenes, not only from the Bible, but also from mythology. Throughout the painting the dominant color is 
                                that of human flesh against the blue sky, with only a few touches of brilliant drapery to echo faintly 
                                the splendors of the Sistine Ceiling. The dead rising from their graves still preserve the colors of the 
                                earth.

                                The “Gioconda” or Mona Lisa was painted by Leonardo Da Vinci between 1503 and 1514. The woman depicted 
                                is Lisa Gherardini, i.e. “Mona” Lisa – the wife of the noble Florentine merchant Francesco del Giocondo 
                                (thus the term “Gioconda” is also used). But did you know that the painting is truly priceless? The Mona 
                                Lisa cannot be bought or sold according to French heritage law. As part of the Louvre collection, 
                                “Mona Lisa” belongs to the public, and by popular agreement, their hearts belong to her. Probably one 
                                of the most famous renaissance paintings of all.

                                The most famous section of the Sistine Chapel ceiling is Michelangelo’s Creation of Adam. It differs 
                                from typical Creation scenes painted up until that time. Here, two figures dominate the scene: God on the 
                                right, and Adam on the left. God is shown inside a floating nebulous form made up of drapery and other 
                                figures. The painting also shows several hallmarks of Michelangelo’s painting style: the lounging position 
                                of both Adam and God, the use of bodies which are both muscular, and the painting of figures who come 
                                across as works of sculpture. It is good to remember that

                                The altarpiece was commissioned in 1512 by Pope Julius II for the church of San Sisto, Piacenza. 
                                The canvas was one of the last Madonnas painted by the artist. Giorgio Vasari called it “a truly 
                                rare and extraordinary work”. Relocated to Dresden from 1754, the well-known painting was 
                                particularly influential in Germany, and after World War II, it was relocated to Moscow for a 
                                decade before returned to Germany. It is now a master piece of the Gemäldegalerie Alte Meister.

                                Leonardo Da Vinci’s “Last Supper”, was made with tempera and oil on a gypsum preparation instead 
                                of the technique commonly used in the fresco period. The subject of the Last Supper is Christ’s 
                                final meal with his apostles before Judas identifies Christ to the authorities who arrest him. 
                                The Last Supper (a Passover Seder), is remembered for two events: Christ says to his apostles 
                                “One of you will betray me,” and the apostles react, each according to his own personality.

                                The School of Athens is a depiction of philosophy. The scene takes place in classical times, 
                                as both the architecture and the garments indicate. Raphael groups the solemn figures of 
                                thinkers and philosophers together in a large, grandiose architectural framework. This 
                                framework is characterized by a high dome, a vault with ceiling and pilasters. It is probably 
                                inspired by late Roman architecture or – as most critics believe – by Bramante’s project for the 
                                new St Peter’s.

                                Ginevra de’ Benci is one of the first known three-quarter-view portraits in Italian art. She eyes 
                                the viewer directly. Born into a wealthy Florentine family, Ginevra de’ Benci was married to Luigi 
                                Niccolini in 1474 at the age of sixteen. It was a customary practice to have a likeness painted on 
                                just such an occasion. Recently, the humanist Bernardo Bembo has been identified as a possible 
                                patron, since Bembo and Ginevra, both married to others, were known to have had a platonic affair, 
                                an accepted convention at the time.

                                Titian was one of the most important Renaissance artists, and his works entered the most 
                                prestigious private and public art collections in the world. Among them there was Cardinal Scipione 
                                Borghese’s art collection. In 1608 he bought Titian’s most mysterious painting, known as Amor sacro 
                                e amor profano, and according to the most realistic hypothesis, the painting is an allegory of two 
                                kinds of love. Vulgar love represented by the naked woman, and celestial love represented by the 
                                clothed woman. Nobody knows for certain what the meaning of Sacred and profane love is, but its 
                                mystery makes it even more fascinating.
