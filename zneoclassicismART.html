                    Neoclassicism was a Western cultural movement in the decorative and visual arts, literature, theatre, 
                    music, and architecture that drew inspiration from the art and culture of classical antiquity.

                                The Death of Marat is a painting by Jacques-Louis David of the murdered French revolutionary leader 
                                Jean-Paul Marat. It is one of the most famous images of the Revolution. David was the leading French 
                                painter, as well as a Montagnard and a member of the revolutionary Committee of General Security. The 
                                painting shows the radical journalist lying dead in his bath on 13 July 1793 after his murder by 
                                Charlotte Corday. Painted in the months after Marat's murder, it has been described by T. J. Clark as 
                                the first modernist painting, for "the way it took the stuff of politics as its material, and did not 
                                transmute it

                                "Source" is an oil painting on canvas by French neoclassical painter Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres. The 
                                work was begun in Florence around 1820 and not completed until 1856, in Paris. When Ingres completed The 
                                Source, he was seventy-six years old, already famous, and president of the École des Beaux-Arts. The pose 
                                of the nude may be compared with that of another by Ingres, the Venus Anadyomene (1848), and is a 
                                reimagination of the Aphrodite of Cnidus or Venus Pudica. Two of Ingres' students, painters Paul Balze 
                                and Alexandre Desgoffe, helped to create the background and water jar.

                                Oedipus and the Sphinx is an 1864 oil on canvas painting by Gustave Moreau that was first exhibited at the 
                                French Salon of 1864 where it was an immediate success. It is now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art. The 
                                work was a fresh treatment of the established subject of the meeting between Oedipus and the Sphinx on the 
                                road to Delphi, notably portrayed at Sophocles' play Oedipus Rex.

                                attendant. Clodion’s highly classicized composition, created during his formative years at the French 
                                Academy in Rome, presents a charming interpretation of a renowned ancient wall painting discovered near 
                                Pompeii and known through prints. Raised modeling emphasizes the female figures’ profiles and drapery, 
                                and delicate incising captures the illusion of their gracefully contoured limbs receding into space.
