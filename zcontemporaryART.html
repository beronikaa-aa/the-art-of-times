                    Contemporary art is the art of today, produced in the second half of the 20th century or in the 21st 
                    century. Contemporary artists work in a globally influenced, culturally diverse, and technologically 
                    advancing world.

                                An iconic piece of art from the pop artist Andy Warhol, Campbell’s Soup Cans illustrates 
                                consumerist culture and mass media in american society. In addition to this, Andy Warhol’s style is 
                                visible in his work. Through the repetition of the represented object, the artist realizes a critique of 
                                a consumer society, which does not stop producing.

                                Standing at a height of 30 meters and evoking the shape of a spider, Maman is one the iconic works of 
                                Louise Bourgeois. The work exists in various versions, with diverse and varied materials. The sculpture 
                                was built for an exhibition at the Tate Modern, and pays homage to the artist’s mother, who died suddenly 
                                when she was only 21 years old.

                                Cecily Brown is known for her luxurious and extremely textured works. Her art is a mix between that of the 
                                baroque masters and abstract expressionism. She mixes color and texture with suggestive, sexually explicit 
                                figures and biomorphic forms that stand out among the abstract swirls that dominate her paintings. By 
                                simply alluding to forms rather than offering a concrete representation, the artist forces the viewer to 
                                properly examine the paintings, from which the erotic images swim into focus.

                                A young dynamic artist, Njideka Akunyili Crosby unites her dual cultural experience in her vibrant works of 
                                art. After spending her formative years in Nigeria, she moved to America at the age of 16 and now lives 
                                and works in Los Angeles. Her intensely personal pieces unite her rich cultural influences, with more 
                                “traditional” acetone paintings superimposed on complex sets, which are often a collation of elements 
                                taken from Nigerian folk culture.

                                This work by Dorothea Tanning marks the beginning of an evolution and passage of figurative surrealism 
                                to more abstract compositions thanks to loose, dynamic strokes and bright colors. The artist created this 
                                work with oil paint and a door segment. This is not one of the artist’s most well-known works. In fact, 
                                the artist became particularly famous for her works Birthday (1942) and Eine Kleine Nachtmusik (1943).

                                The painting that kick started the career of Jenny Saville is a striking self portrait. Saville made a 
                                name for herself with her large portraits (often self-portraits) showing women who do not conform to 
                                society’s usual beauty standards, but who reflect the grand diversity of beauty in women. Her distinctive 
                                handling of oil paintings and her warm skin tones are reminiscent of Lucian Freud and Francis Bacon.

                                Lucian Freud is known for his figurative depictions. All his work is autobiographical and all his 
                                self-portraits were made with the help of mirrors. This work is a perfect example of the artistic style 
                                of its creator: each line, every defect of his face and skin are visible. The grandson of the psychologist 
                                Sigmund Freud is considered by many to be an artist who portrays his subjects in a brutal way. He 
                                therefore offers the public a glimpse into their minds and their worlds.

                                The ceiling of the Opera Garnier in Paris is certainly one of the most famous works by Chagall. It has 
                                been very controversial from the time it was created until its official opening in 1964. In fact, the 
                                various panels were assembled under protection from military guards. This vibrant piece is considered as 
                                reflecting Chagall’s status as “one of the great painters of our time” and contains references to famous 
                                composers and artists throughout history.

                                his works on a very large scale. For the artist, his work had to be “very intimate and human”. He

                                intimacy and transcendence between the work and the audience.
